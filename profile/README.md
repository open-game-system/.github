# Open Game System 🎮

Adding native capabilities to web games through open protocols and standards. ✨

Open Game System is an open-source initiative that enables web games to access native mobile capabilities through standardized protocols. 📱 We're building a cross-platform ecosystem that bridges the gap between web and native experiences, allowing developers to add authentication, push notifications, and TV casting to their games without complex native implementations.

The Open Game System (OGS) provides protocols, SDKs, and services that let web-based games leverage native mobile capabilities like push notifications and Chromecast integration. 🔌 Our ecosystem is designed to be web-first, protocol-based, and platform-independent, enabling game developers to maintain their own identity while accessing powerful native features.

Our repositories contain:
- 📋 Protocol specifications for account linking, push notifications, and TV casting
- 💻 Client SDKs that implement these protocols with minimal code
- ⚙️ Server implementations powering the ecosystem
- 📱 A mobile companion app that bridges web games with native features

Whether you're building a casual web game or a complex multiplayer experience, OGS helps you extend your reach across platforms while staying web-first. 🚀

## Key Features

- 🌐 **Web-First Architecture**: Everything is designed for games that live primarily on the web
- 🔄 **Protocol-Based Approach**: Clear communication protocols between web games and native capabilities
- 🔐 **Independent Identity**: Games maintain their own authentication and user management
- 📱 **Cross-Platform Support**: Works across browsers, iOS, Android, and smart TVs
- 📦 **TypeScript SDKs**: Well-documented TypeScript libraries with React components

## Getting Started

Start by exploring our [specification](https://github.com/open-game-system/specification) repository to understand the protocols, then integrate the appropriate SDKs into your game: 🛠️
- 🔑 [auth-kit](https://github.com/open-game-system/auth-kit) for account linking
- 🔔 [notification-kit](https://github.com/open-game-system/notification-kit) for push notifications
- 📺 [cast-kit](https://github.com/open-game-system/cast-kit) for TV casting

Each repository contains comprehensive documentation in its README file with integration guides, API references, and usage examples. 📚
